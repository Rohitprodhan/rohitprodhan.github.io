## 👋 About Me

I am currently pursuing an **MS by Research in Physics at IIT Bombay**. My academic background lies at the intersection of physics, computation, and applied mathematics—but I am equally passionate about **Machine Learning** and **Financial Engineering**.

In my research, I am involved in two major projects:

- **Mean Field Models for Non-Equilibrium Systems**:  
  This project focuses on modeling active matter using mean-field theory. It involves solving complex **nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs)** using numerical methods—combining deep physical intuition with computational rigor.

- **Data-Driven Discovery of Hydrodynamic Equations**:  
  Here, I use **machine learning techniques** to predict coarse-grained hydrodynamic equations from **particle-level simulations**. This work lies at the intersection of physics-informed ML, statistical mechanics, and dynamical systems.

## 💼 Career Interests

I am actively seeking opportunities in:
- **Quantitative Research** roles in the financial industry  
- **Data Science** positions where I can leverage my analytical and modeling skills

My interest in finance began during my coursework in **Advanced Statistical Mechanics**, where I was first introduced to **stochastic calculus**. This foundational knowledge led me to pursue a dedicated course in **Financial Engineering (IE612)**, where I deepened my understanding of financial models, derivatives, and risk analytics.

## 🚀 Ongoing Learning

I'm currently exploring **Reinforcement Learning**, focusing on its applications in quantitative modeling. I’m following the **David Silver lecture series** and implementing key algorithms in Python.
